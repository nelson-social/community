# Onboarding

We’ll socialise and introduce new members when they join. They’ll get a warm welcome on the app, as well as a welcome email with some helpful tips. 

## Introduction

The person inviting their friend will introduce them in a post and prompt them to share a bit about themselves.

```
Everyone, meet my friend @USERNAME! #introduction

- How do you know them?
- What's their thing, what do they do?
- What's curious about them?
- What's something you appreciate about them?
- Any particular reason why they were invited?

What else should people know about, <NAME>?
```
