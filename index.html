        <h2 id="about">About nelson.social</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to nelson.social, an online space dedicated to the community
          of Nelson, BC! We’re excited to build a place where people from all
          walks of life can come together to share ideas and passions, build
          connections, or just hang out and chat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here at nelson.social, we believe in the power of community and the
          importance of supporting one another in order to enrich our community.
          Whether you are a lifelong resident of Nelson, new to the region, or
          just passing through, we invite you to join the conversation and be a
          part of our community.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this space, you can share your thoughts and ideas, ask questions of
          your neighbours, and even plan events and activities. You can also
          connect with people from all over the world, because nelson.social is
          part of the
          <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/">Mastodon</a> network. We like
          to think of it like a big WhatsApp or iMessage group, but where you
          can choose who to share with and whose messages you see, even if they
          aren’t members of nelson.social.
        </p>
        <p>
          We expect our members to be respectful and considerate of others, and
          to use this space to help build a stronger, more connected community
          in Nelson. We have a simple set of rules for the space that help the
          team that runs nelson.social ensure that we can be welcoming for
          everyone. Please read them, and reach out to us if you encounter any
          problems, or have any questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We look forward to seeing you on nelson.social, and to building a
          vibrant and supportive community together. Welcome!
        </p>
        <h2 id="land">Land Acknowledgement</h2>
        <p>
          We would like to acknowledge that in Nelson we live and work on the
          traditional, ancestral and unceded territory of Sinixt Peoples. We
          make this acknowledgment to show our respect for the tmxʷulaʔxʷ
          (homeland), and

          Nation. We feel privileged and grateful to be here, and we invite
          those reading this to explore their own relationship to place.
        </p>
        <h2 id="conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          Nelson is home to people from all over the world who have a diverse
          set of skills, personalities, backgrounds and experiences. This
          diversity is wonderful, and we are committed to ensuring that the
          nelson.social community is a safe, enjoyable and thriving environment
          for the largest number possible of Nelson residents, their friends and
          family members.
        </p>
        <p>
          To that end, we will strive to make this a friendly, safe and
          welcoming environment for everyone regardless of qualities such as
          their gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability,
          mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size,
          age, race, nationality, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, family
          structure, spirituality, religion (or lack thereof), education, or
          other personal traits. We particularly celebrate diversity and do not
          tolerate bigotry or prejudice.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a community, we expect any participant to act according to the
          guidelines in this document. They ensure that everyone within the
          community is clear about the behaviour that is expected of them, and
          that newcomers know what kind of environment they can expect to find
          here.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a living document, and the&nbsp;nelson.social
          team&nbsp;welcome your feedback. We will amend this document as
          necessary to ensure the safety of our users.
        </p>
        <h3>Guiding principle</h3>
        <p>
          <em
            >If you wouldn't do it in Oso Negro, don't do it on
            nelson.social</em
          >
        </p>
        <h3>Handling conflict</h3>
        <p>
          A diverse group of people has a diverse set of boundaries about what
          is OK. Sometimes one of us may make a mistake, and do something that
          inadvertently causes offence. When we observe this happen, we try to
          give the offender feedback quickly, clearly and constructively. We try
          to offer them the opportunity to maintain their dignity in the
          situation, to learn from and repair their mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
          This kind of learning and repair is how we strengthen our
          relationships and our community. However we will not tolerate anyone
          deliberately or repeatedly breaking these rules.
        </p>
        <h3>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
        <p>
          Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including those with
          decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
          immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community
          organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and
          including a temporary suspension or permanent ban from the community
          without warning.
        </p>
        <h3>Reporting Guidelines</h3>
        <p>
          If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, please use the
          "Report user" functionality of Mastodon. If the situation is beyond
          unacceptable behavior, please notify any of the
          <a href="#team">Team</a> via direct message. We are here to help you.
          Your reports will be taken seriously, treated in confidence and will
          not be dismissed or argued with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, community organizers are available to help community
          members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those
          experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe.
        </p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Provide a safe and welcoming community space for discussing Nelson
            &amp; area activities, news, events, and experiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide a venue for both casual and serious conversation, with the
            ability for users to opt-out of unwanted content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fun! We aim to foster a community of individuals and business that
            love being here in the Kootenays. We welcome personal posts, event
            notices and organizing.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Non-Goals</h3>
        <p>
          While it's important to know what nelson.social is, it's just as
          important to understand what nelson.social is not. Nelson.social is
          not:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A money-making exercise. This is a community-run website, made of
            open-source software, hosted and moderated by volunteers who live in
            your community. We are not going to

            so that we can show you more ads. In fact, there are no ads!
          </li>
          <li>
            A "free speech" zone. We encourage authentic, curious, respectful
            conversation, including disagreement, but we do not tolerate all
            forms of speech. We do not tolerate hate speech
            of&nbsp;any&nbsp;kind.

            debating is equally unwelcome, as is misinformation.
          </li>
          <li>
            A place for general advertisement. Promoting your original work is
            welcome, but please avoid overly commercial self-promotion
          </li>
        </ul>

          to be a better fit if you don't like these rules.
        </p>
        <h3>Encouraged Behavior</h3>
        <p>
          The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community
          members:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be friendly, open and welcoming.</li>
          <li>
            Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you
            contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
          </li>
          <li>Attempt collaboration &amp; de-escalation before conflict.</li>
          <li>
            If you inadvertently cause offence to someone else, take
            responsibility for your actions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and
            speech.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be mindful of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if
            you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations
            of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
        <p>
          To be specific, the following behaviors are unacceptable within our
          community:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Anything in violation of our
            <a href="https://nelson.social/terms" rel="nofollow"
              >Terms of Service</a
            >
            including posting anything illegal in British Columbia or Canada.
          </li>
          <li>
            Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against
            another person.
          </li>

            Using slurs or racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or
            otherwise discriminatory or hateful jokes or language; promoting
            white supremacy, anti-Semitism, transphobia, castism or other

          </li>
          <li>Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
          <li>
            Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying
            information ("doxing").
          </li>
          <li>
            Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual
            orientation, race, religion, or disability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or

          </li>
          <li>
            Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in
            person).
          </li>
          <li>
            Debating moderation actions in public. If you disagree with how a
            moderator enforced this Code of Conduct you may direct-message the
            moderation team.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tone policing. Messages you see on nelson.social may violate the
            standards of civility we set on nelson.social, but you should not
            criticize users for their tone. If the user is a member of the
            nelson.social community, you should report them; if not, you should
            feel free to block them. In neither case should you criticize their
            tone.
          </li>
          <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Again, we suggest you
          <a href="https://instances.social/" rel="nofollow"
            >find another server</a
          >
          or even
          <a href="https://runyourown.social/" rel="nofollow"
            >set up your own</a
          >
          if you don't agree with these rules.
        </p>
        <h3>Addressing Grievances</h3>
        <p>
          If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating
          this Code of Conduct, you should notify
          <a href="mailto:admin@nelson.social">admin@nelson.social</a> with a
          concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled
          in due course by the moderation team.
        </p>
        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>
          We expect all community participants to abide by this Code of Conduct
          in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all
          one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.
        </p>
        <p>
          This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to
          unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community
          activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect
          the safety and well-being of community members.
