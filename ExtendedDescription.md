## About

Welcome to nelson.social, an online space dedicated to the community of Nelson, BC! We’re excited to build a place where people from all walks of life can come together to share ideas and passions, build connections, or just hang out and chat.

Here at nelson.social, we believe in the power of community and the importance of supporting one another in order to enrich our community. Whether you are a lifelong resident of Nelson, new to the region, or just passing through, we invite you to join the conversation and be a part of our community.

In this space, you can share your thoughts and ideas, ask questions of your neighbours, and even plan events and activities. You can also connect with people from all over the world, because nelson.social is part of the [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/) network. We like to think of it like a big WhatsApp or iMessage group, but where you can choose who to share with and whose messages you see, even if they aren’t members of nelson.social.

### Goals

1. Provide a safe and welcoming community space for discussing Nelson & area activities, news, events, and experiences
2. Provide a venue for both casual and serious conversation, with the ability for users to opt-out of unwanted content
3. Fun! We aim to foster a community of individuals and business that love being here in the Kootenays. We welcome personal posts, event notices and organizing

### Non-Goals

nelson.social is not:

- A money-making exercise. This is a community-run website, made of open-source software, hosted and moderated by volunteers who live in your community. We are not going to [sell your data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal), or try to get you [addicted](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/09/facebook-sean-parker-vulnerability-brain-psychology) so that we can show you more ads. In fact, there are no ads!
- A "free speech" zone. We encourage authentic, curious, respectful conversation, including disagreement, but we do not tolerate all forms of speech. We do not tolerate hate speech of any kind. [Bad-faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith) debating is equally unwelcome, as is misinformation.
- A place for general advertisement. Promoting your original work is welcome, but please avoid overly commercial self-promotion

You may [find another server](https://instances.social/) to be a better fit if you don't like these rules.

## Land Acknowledgement
