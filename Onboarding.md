# Onboarding

Weâ€™ll socialise and introduce new members when they join, by giving them a warm welcome on the app. Additionally they'll get an email with all the information needed to get started. This way they can familiarize themselves in their own time and lookup information later on.

## Introduction

The person inviting their friend will introduce them in a post and prompt them to share a bit about themselves.

```
Everyone, meet my friend @USERNAME! #introduction

- How do you know them?
- What's their thing, what do they do?
- What's curious about them?
- What's something you appreciate about them?
- Any particular reason why they were invited?

What else should people know about, <NAME>?
```

## Welcome email

We'll send an automated welcome email to new members that to help them familiarize with the platform and community.
