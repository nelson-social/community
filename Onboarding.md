# Onboarding

We’ll socialise and introduce new members when they join. They’ll get a warm welcome on the app, as well as a welcome email with some helpful tips. 

## Introduction

The person inviting their friend will introduce them in a post and prompt them to share a bit about themselves.

```
Everyone, meet my friend @USERNAME! #introduction

- How do you know them?

Welcome to nelson.social!

We're an online space dedicated to the community of Nelson, BC! We’re excited to build a place where people from all walks of life can come together to share ideas and passions, build connections, or just hang out and chat. In this space, you can share your thoughts and ideas, ask questions of your neighbours, and even plan events and activities. You can also connect with people from all over the world, because nelson.social is part of the Mastodon network. We like to think of it like a big WhatsApp or iMessage group, but where you can choose who to share with and whose messages you see, even if they aren’t members of nelson.social.

We've started this community because Facebook is toxic AF, Twitter is dying and living in Zuck's Metaverse isn't the future we want. Nelson.social a space that's owned by the community, not by some corpo-overlord.

Our community is intentionally inclusively exclusive to create a safe and respectful vibe. If you want to invite someone who can self-regulate and doesn't need moderation, please do.
