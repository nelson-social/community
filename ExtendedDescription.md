## About nelson.social

Welcome to nelson.social, an online space dedicated to the community of Nelson, BC! We’re excited to build a place where people from all walks of life can come together to share ideas and passions, build connections, or just hang out and chat.

Here at nelson.social, we believe in the power of community and the importance of supporting one another in order to enrich our community. Whether you are a lifelong resident of Nelson, new to the region, or just passing through, we invite you to join the conversation and be a part of our community.

In this space, you can share your thoughts and ideas, ask questions of your neighbours, and even plan events and activities. You can also connect with people from all over the world, because nelson.social is part of the [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/) network. We like to think of it like a big WhatsApp or iMessage group, but where you can choose who to share with and whose messages you see, even if they aren’t members of nelson.social.

We expect our members to be respectful and considerate of others, and to use this space to help build a stronger, more connected community in Nelson. We have a simple set of rules for the space that help the team that runs nelson.social ensure that we can be welcoming for everyone. Please read them, and reach out to us if you encounter any problems, or have any questions.

We look forward to seeing you on nelson.social, and to building a vibrant and supportive community together. Welcome!

We make this acknowledgment to show our respect for the tmxʷulaʔxʷ (homeland), and [Sinixt](https://bloodoflifecollective.org/sinixt.html) Nation. We feel privileged and grateful to be here, and we invite those reading this to explore their own relationship to place.

## Code of Conduct

Nelson is home to people from all over the world who have a diverse set of skills, personalities, backgrounds and experiences. This diversity is wonderful, and we are committed to ensuring that the nelson.social community is a safe, enjoyable and thriving environment for the largest number possible of Nelson residents, their friends and family members.

To that end, we will strive to make this a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for everyone regardless of qualities such as their gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, nationality, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, family structure, spirituality, religion (or lack thereof), education, or other personal traits. We particularly celebrate diversity and do not tolerate bigotry or prejudice.

As a community, we expect any participant to act according to the following ground rules. They ensure that everyone within the community is clear about the behaviour that is expected of them, and that newcomers know what kind of environment they can expect to find here.

This is a living document, and the nelson.social team welcome your feedback. We will amend this document as necessary to ensure the safety of our users.

### Guiding principle

*If you wouldn't do it in Oso Negro, don't do it on nelson.social*

### Handling conflict

A diverse group of people has a diverse set of boundaries about what is OK. Sometimes one of us may make a mistake, and do something that inadvertently causes offence. When we observe this happen, we try to give the offender feedback quickly, clearly and constructively. We try to offer them the opportunity to maintain their dignity in the situation, to learn from and repair their mistake.

This kind of learning and repair is how we strengthen our relationships and our community. However we will not tolerate anyone deliberately or repeatedly breaking these rules.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

### Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please [notify a community organizer](#team) by emailing [admin@nelson.social](mailto:admin@nelson.social) as soon as possible. We are here to help you. Your reports will be taken seriously, treated in confidence and will not be dismissed or argued with.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe.

### Goals

1. Provide a safe and welcoming community space for discussing Nelson & area activities, news, events, and experiences.
1. Provide a venue for both casual and serious conversation, with the ability for users to opt-out of unwanted content.
1. Fun! We aim to foster a community of individuals and business that love being here in the Kootenays. We welcome personal posts, event notices and organizing.

### Non-Goals

While it's important to know what nelson.social is, it's just as important to understand what nelson.social is not. Nelson.social is not:

* A money-making exercise. This is a community-run website, made of open-source software, hosted and moderated by volunteers who live in your community. We are not going to [sell your data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal), or try to get you [addicted](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/09/facebook-sean-parker-vulnerability-brain-psychology) so that we can show you more ads. In fact, there are no ads!
* A "free speech" zone. We encourage authentic, curious, respectful conversation, including disagreement, but we do not tolerate all forms of speech. We do not tolerate hate speech of any kind. [Bad-faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith) debating is equally unwelcome, as is misinformation.
* A place for general advertisement. Promoting your original work is welcome, but please avoid overly commercial self-promotion

You may [find another server](https://instances.social/) to be a better fit if you don't like these rules.

### Encouraged Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

* Be friendly, open and welcoming.
* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration & de-escalation before conflict.
* If you inadvertently cause offence to someone else, take responsibility for your actions.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
  
### Unacceptable Behavior

To be specific, the following behaviors are unacceptable within our community:

* Anything in violation of our [Terms of Service](https://nelson.social/terms) including posting anything illegal in Canada.
* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
* Using slurs or racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or hateful jokes or language; promoting white supremacy, anti-Semitism, transphobia, castism or other hateful ideologies.
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; unwelcomed sexual advances.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
* Debating moderation actions in public. If you disagree with how a moderator enforced this Code of Conduct you may direct-message the moderation team.
* Tone policing. Messages you see on nelson.social may violate the standards of civility we set on nelson.social, but you should not criticize users for their tone. If the user is a member of the nelson.social community, you should report them; if not, you should feel free to block them. In neither case should you criticize their tone.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

Again, we suggest you [find another server](https://instances.social/) or even [set up your own](https://runyourown.social/) if you don't agree with these rules.

### Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify admin@nelson.social with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in due course by the moderation team.

### Scope

We expect all community participants to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Team

This server is hosted and run by a team of volunteers who live here in Nelson, BC:

* [@blaine](https://nelson.social/web/@blaine)
* [@matt](https://nelson.social/web/@matt)
* [@till](https://nelson.social/web/@till)

We're well aware that we're three privileged white dudes (though only one born-Canadian! Yay im/migration!) and while we are happy to continue to pay for the costs of running the service and volunteer our labour, we would like to diversify the team, divest ourselves of power and would gladly welcome volunteers (and eventually paid staff, if appropriate) to help or lead decision-making. Please get in touch if you'd like to get involved!
